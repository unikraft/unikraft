	default OPTIMIZE_PERF
	help
	  Set the optimization level for gcc

config OPTIMIZE_NONE
	bool "No optimizations"
	help
		Do not optimize, use -O0.

config OPTIMIZE_PERF
	bool "Optimize for performance"
	help
		Optimize code for performance,

config OPTIMIZE_SIZE
	bool "Optimize for size"
	help
		Optimize code for size.
endchoice

comment "Hint: Specify a CPU type to get most benefits from performance optimization"
	depends on OPTIMIZE_PERF && (MARCH_X86_64_GENERIC || MARCH_ARM64_GENERIC)

config OPTIMIZE_NOOMITFP
	bool "Keep stack frame pointers"
	default y
	help
		Reserves one CPU register for using it as stack frame pointer.
		Functions are instrumented to save, set up, and restore frame
		pointers. This option simplifies doing stack walks for
		debugging for instance.

config OPTIMIZE_DEADELIM
	bool "Drop unused functions and data"
	default n
	help
		Drop unused functions and data. They will not be copied
		into the final binary. This might save further space but linking time
		will increase.

comment "Hint: Enable dropping of unused code to further reduce target image size"
	depends on OPTIMIZE_SIZE && !OPTIMIZE_DEADELIM

config OPTIMIZE_LTO
	bool "LTO - Link time optimizations (EXPERIMENTAL)"
	default n
	help
		Enables GCC to do code optimizations during linking. This option
		will increase overall building time but creates more efficient
		Unikraft binaries.

choice
	prompt "Debug information level"
	default DEBUG_SYMBOLS_LVL3
	help
		Set the level of available debugging information.

config DEBUG_SYMBOLS_LVL0
	bool "Level 0 (-g0), None"
	help
		No debugging information. This option is not recommended.
		Building time is reduced.

config DEBUG_SYMBOLS_LVL1
	bool "Level 1 (-g1)"
	help
		Minimal debugging information, enough
		for making backtraces in parts of the program that
		you don't plan to debug. This includes descriptions
		of functions and external variables, but no information
		about local variables and no line numbers.

config DEBUG_SYMBOLS_LVL2
	bool "Level 2 (-g2)"
	help
		gcc's default setting

config DEBUG_SYMBOLS_LVL3
	bool "Level 3 (-g3)"
	help
		Level 3 includes extra information, such as all the
		macro definitions present in the program. Some debuggers
		support macro expansion.

config OPTIMIZE_WARNISERROR
	bool "Treat warnings as errors"
	default n
	help
		When this option is enabled, the build system stops
		compilation when a compiler warning is displayed.

config OPTIMIZE_SYMFILE
	bool "Create a symbols file"
	default n
	help
		Create a separate file with all symbol locations

config OPTIMIZE_COMPRESS
	bool "Compress images"
	default y
	help
		Create compressed images. Please note that not all platforms
		support compressing.

config RECORD_BUILDTIME
	bool "Keep track of Building time"
	default n
	help
		Record time (and resources) used by each build step

if RECORD_BUILDTIME

	        default RECORD_BUILDTIME_TIME
		help
			Select which tool is used for recording the build steps

	config RECORD_BUILDTIME_TIME
	bool "time"
	help
		Use time command to record process statistics during building

	config RECORD_BUILDTIME_LIFTOFF
	bool "liftoff"
	help
		Use liftoff to record process statistics during building
		Get it from https://github.com/sysml/liftoff

config CROSS_COMPILE
	string "Custom cross-compiler tool prefix (optional)"
	help
		Same as running 'make CROSS_COMPILE=prefix-' but stored for
		default make runs in this build directory.  You don't
		need to set this unless you want the configured build
		directory to select the cross-compiler automatically.


config LLVM_TARGET_ARCH
	string "Custom cross-compiler LLVM target (optional)"
	help
		Same as running 'make LLVM_TARGET_ARCH=target' but stored for
		default make runs in this build directory.  You don't
		need to set this unless you want the configured build
		directory to select the cross-compiler automatically.
		This is used for LLVM based compilers such as clang or rustc.
#config PARALLEL_JOBS
#	int "Number of jobs to run simultaneously (0 for auto)"
#	default "0"
#	help
#	  Number of jobs to run simultaneously.  If 0, determine
#	  automatically according to number of CPUs on the host
#	  system.
