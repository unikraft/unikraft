/**
 * ## Overview
 *
 * `uk_event` decouples the definition of an event and the definition of
 * callback routines that should be called whenever the event ocurrs. This way
 * a library (A) can provide an event and a library (B) can register handlers
 * for this event without creating a dependency (A)->(B). Handler registration
 * is done at link time by collecting all handler functions for a particular
 * event and putting their addresses into an event-specific function table.
 * Handlers can indicate that they have handled the event, in which case no
 * other handlers are called, if desired. Handlers can also be assigned a
 * priority class to enforce a certain execution order.
 *
 * ## Using Events
 *
 * In the following, we define an event `myevent` in library (A). We encapsulate
 * additional event-specific information in `struct myevent_data`. Library (B)
 * includes the declaration of `struct myevent_data` and registers three
 * handler functions, where `myhandler1` and `myhandler2` allow other handlers
 * to be called afterwards and `myhandler3` terminates handler invocation.
 * Note: Since there are no guarantees in which order handlers of the same
 * priority class may be called, it is only guaranteed that `handler1` will be
 * the first of libB's handlers that is invoked. However, `handler2` may or may
 * not be called depending on if `handler3` is executed before.
 *
 * **libA/include/uk/myevent.h**:
 * ```C
 * struct myevent_data {
 *       int dummy;
 * };
 * ```
 * **libA/myevent.c:**
 * ```C
 * #include <uk/event.h>
 * #include <uk/myevent.h>
 *
 * UK_EVENT(myevent);
 *
 * void some_function(void)
 * {
 *       struct myevent_data = { .dummy = 42 };
 *       int rc;
 *
 *       rc = uk_raise_event(myevent, &myevent_data);
 *       if (!rc)
 *               uk_pr_err("myevent not handled!\n");
 * }
 * ```
 * **libB/myhandler.c:**
 * ```C
 * #include <uk/event.h>
 * #include <uk/myevent.h>
 *
 * int handler1(void *arg)
 * {
 *       struct myevent_data *data = (struct myevent_data *)arg;
 *       ...
 *       return UK_EVENT_HANDLED_CONT;
 * }
 *
 * int handler2(void *arg)
 * {
 *       return UK_EVENT_HANDLED_CONT;
 * }
 *
 * int handler3(void *arg)
 * {
 *       return UK_EVENT_HANDLED;
 * }
 *
 * UK_EVENT_HANDLER_PRIO(handler1, UK_PRIO_EARLIEST);
 * UK_EVENT_HANDLER_PRIO(handler2, UK_PRIO_LATEST);
 * UK_EVENT_HANDLER_PRIO(handler3, UK_PRIO_LATEST);
 * ```
