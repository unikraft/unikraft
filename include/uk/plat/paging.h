 *
 *   paddr should be 0 if physical addresses should be handled by the mapx page

 * @param pages
 *   The number of pages in requested page size to map
 * @param attr
 *   Page attributes to set for the new mapping (see PAGE_ATTR_* flags)
 * @param flags
 *   Page flags (see PAGE_FLAG_* flags)
 *
 *   The page size can be specified with PAGE_FLAG_SIZE(). If
 *   PAGE_FLAG_FORCE_SIZE is not specified, the function tries to map the given
 *   range (i.e., pages * requested page size) using the largest possible pages.
 *   The actual mapping thus may use larger or smaller pages than requested
 *   depending on address alignment, supported page sizes, and, if paddr is
 *   __PADDR_ANY, the available contiguous physical memory. If
 *   PAGE_FLAG_FORCE_SIZE is specified, only mappings of the given page size
 *   are created.
 *
 *   If PAGE_FLAG_KEEP_PTES is specified, the new mapping will incorporate the
 *   PTEs currently present in the page table. The physical address and
 *   permission flags will be updated according to the new mapping.
 * @param mapx
 *   Optional page mapper object. If the page mapper is supplied, it is called
 *   right before applying a new PTE, giving the mapper a chance to affect the
 *   mapping. Depending on the return code of the mapper it is also possible to
 *   skip the current PTE or force a smaller page size (if PAGE_FLAG_FORCE_SIZE
 *   is not set). Note that the page mapper is not called for PTEs referencing
 *   other page tables.
 *
 *   If paddr is __PADDR_ANY, the PTE supplied to the mapper will point to newly
 *   allocated physical memory that can be initialized before becoming visible.
 *   Use PT_Lx_PTE_PADDR() to retrieve the physical address from the PTE and
 *   ukplat_page_kmap() to temporarily map the physical memory. Note that, if
 *   the PTE currently present in the page table already points to a valid
 *   mapping (i.e., PT_Lx_PTE_PRESENT() returns a non-zero value), no new
 *   physical memory will be allocated. Instead, the physical address will
 *   remain unchanged. It is the mapper's responsibilty to properly free the
 *   referenced physical memory, if the physical address is changed.
 *
 *   Before calling the page mapper, existing large pages may be split up if a
 *   smaller page size is enforced.
 *
 * @return
 *   0 on success, a non-zero value otherwise. May fail if:
 *   - the physical or virtual address is not aligned to the page size
 *   - a page in the region is already mapped and no mapx is supplied
 *   - a page table could not be set up
 *   - if __PADDR_ANY flag is set and there are no more free frames
