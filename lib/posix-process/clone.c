/* NOTE: From man pages about clone(2)
 *       [https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/clone.2.html]:
 *       "The raw clone() system call corresponds more closely to fork(2)
 *        in that execution in the child continues from the point of the
 *        call.  As such, the fn and arg arguments of the clone() wrapper
 *        function are omitted.
 *
 *        In contrast to the glibc wrapper, the raw clone() system call
 *        accepts NULL as a stack argument (and clone3() likewise allows
 *        cl_args.stack to be NULL).  In this case, the child uses a
 *        duplicate of the parent's stack.  (Copy-on-write semantics ensure
 *        that the child gets separate copies of stack pages when either
 *        process modifies the stack.)  In this case, for correct
 *        operation, the CLONE_VM option should not be specified.  (If the
 *        child shares the parent's memory because of the use of the
 *        CLONE_VM flag, then no copy-on-write duplication occurs and chaos
 *        is likely to result.)
 *
 *        The order of the arguments also differs in the raw system call,
 *        and there are variations in the arguments across architectures,
 *        as detailed in the following paragraphs.
 *
 *        The raw system call interface on x86-64 and some other
 *        architectures (including sh, tile, and alpha) is:
 *
 *            long clone(unsigned long flags, void *stack,
 *                       int *parent_tid, int *child_tid,
 *                       unsigned long tls);
 *
 *        On x86-32, and several other common architectures (including
 *        score, ARM, ARM 64, PA-RISC, arc, Power PC, xtensa, and MIPS),
 *        the order of the last two arguments is reversed:
 *
 *            long clone(unsigned long flags, void *stack,
 *                       int *parent_tid, unsigned long tls,
 *                       int *child_tid);
 *       "
