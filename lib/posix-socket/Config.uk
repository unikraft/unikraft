		This microlibrary allows other microlibraries to register a
		socket family number, such as AF_INET, for their socket
		implementation and provides the POSIX socket API unikernel-wide
		and acts appropriately on a given file descriptor.

		The API includes prototypes for socket(), accept(), bind(),
		shutdown(), connect(), listen(), send(), sendmsg(), sendto(),
		recv(), recvfrom(), recvmsg(), getpeername(), getsockname(),
		getsockopt() and setsockopt().

		With socket events connection states and endpoints can be tracked
		independently of the target address family. This happens in the
		following situtations:
		- LISTEN: The host listens for incoming connections
		- ACCEPT: An incoming connection request is accepted
		- CONNECT: A connection to a remote endpoint is established
		- CLOSE: A connection or listener is closed
