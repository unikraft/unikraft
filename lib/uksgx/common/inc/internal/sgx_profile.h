Some notes for using the profiling macros

1. Define _PROFILE_ before including "sgx_profile.h" will enable the profiling, 
   also need to include sgx_profile.cpp in the compiling process
2. When use it in multi-threaded application, please don't trigger profiling in multiple threads at the same time.  
   The implementation is not thread-safe now,  to avoid additional latency introduced by locks
3. PROFILE_OUTPUT macro should only be used once before application exits
4. PROFILE_START and PROFILE_END should be paired, otherwise PROFILE_OUTPUT will abort the program when detects the mismatch

A simple example to use PROFILE macro

#define _PROFILE_  
#include "sgx_profile.h"

...
PROFILE_INIT();
...

PROFILE_START("func1");
func1();
PROFILE_END("func1");

...

PROFILE_START("func2");
func2();
PROFILE_END("func2");

...

PROFILE_OUTPUT("C:\\work\\output.csv");
...
