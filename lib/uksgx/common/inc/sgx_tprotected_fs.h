/* sgx_fopen
 *  Purpose: open existing protected file (created with previous call to sgc_fopen) or create a new one (see c++ fopen documentation for more details).
 *
 *  Parameters:
 *      filename - [IN] the name of the file to open/create.
 *      mode - [IN] open mode. only supports 'r' or 'w' or 'a' (one and only one of them must be present), and optionally 'b' and/or '+'.
 *      key - [IN] encryption key that will be used for the file encryption
 *      NOTE - the key is actually used as a KDK (key derivation key) and only for the meta-data node, and not used directly for the encryption of any part of the file
 *             this is important in order to prevent hitting the key wear-out problem, and some other issues with GCM encryptions using the same key
 *
 *  Return value:
 *     SGX_FILE*  - pointer to the newly created file handle, NULL if an error occurred - check errno for the error code.

/* sgx_fopen_auto_key
*  Purpose: open existing protected file (created with previous call to sgc_fopen_auto_key) or create a new one (see c++ fopen documentation for more details).
*           this API doesn't require a key from the user, and instead uses the enclave's SEAL key as a KDK for deriving the mete-data encryption keys
*           using the SEAL key as a KDK, may result losing file access in cases of disaster-recovery or in cases of VM migration in servers
*           users that any of these scenarious apply to them, are advised to use sgx_fopen, where they can provide their own key and manage the keys provisioning for those scenarious
*           for further information, please read the SGX SDK manual
*
*  Parameters:
*      filename - [IN] the name of the file to open/create.
*      mode - [IN] open mode. only supports 'r' or 'w' or 'a' (one and only one of them must be present), and optionally 'b' and/or '+'.
*
*  Return value:
*     SGX_FILE*  - pointer to the newly created file handle, NULL if an error occurred - check errno for the error code.
