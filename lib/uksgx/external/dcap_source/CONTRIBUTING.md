## Issues

GitHub Issues tracks Intel(R) Software Guard Extensions Data Center Attestation Primitives (Intel(R) SGX DCAP) design and development issues, bugs, and feature requests.
For usage, installation, or other requests for help, please use the [01.org](https://01.org/intel-software-guard-extensions/forum/forum) forum instead. 

When reporting a bug, please provide the following information, where applicable:

* What are the steps to reproduce the bug?
* Can you reproduce the bug using the latest [master](https://github.com/intel/SGXDataCenterAttestationPrimitives/tree/master)?
* What CPU, platform, operating system/distribution, SGX driver, SGX SDK and SGX PSW are you running? The more specific, the better.
* For crashes, please provide the backtrace (use gdb).


### Contribution Guide

We accept contributions as pull requests on GitHub. More detailed guidelines will be added later. Please follow these simple rules for now: 

* A PR should have a clear purpose, and do one thing only, and nothing more. This will enable us review your PR more quickly.
* Each commit in PR should be a small, atomic change representing one step in development.
* Please squash intermediate steps within PR for bugfixes, style cleanups, reversions, etc., so they would not appear in merged PR history.
* Please explain anything non-obvious from the code in comments, commit messages, or the PR description, as appropriate.

### Sign your work
