Rdrand Library
----------------------------
Welcome to the Rdrand Library. This is a simple library aimed at
bringing suport for the rdrdand instruction feature of Intel processors
starting with the Intel(r) microarchitecture code name Ivy Bridge, (also known
as 3rd Generation Intel Core(tm) processor) to users with toolchains that do 
not support this new feature.  For more information on the rdrand instruction, 
please visit http://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/download-the-latest-bull-mountain-software-implementation-guide/
The new rdrand instruction is innovative hardware approach to high-quality,
high-performance entropy and random number generation. Because the many of 
compiler toolchains do not support this new instruction, this library was 
created to facilitate easy access to it. The idea is simple: link to a 
built static library and enjoy the new feature!  Or, if you wish the full 
source code is provided.

Documentation is stored in doc/--Point your browser to doc/html/index.html to get
started. Included in the documentation is more information about the 
rdrand instruction, build instructions, and information on supported 
toolchains.

There is also a demonstration project using Microsoft* Visual Studio* project
file named "Test" that demonstrate linking to the generated library.
