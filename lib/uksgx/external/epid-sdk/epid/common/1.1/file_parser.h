/// Extracts group public key from buffer in issuer binary format
/*!

  Extracts the first group public key from a buffer with format of
  Intel(R) EPID 1.1 Group Public Key Certificate Binary File. The
  function validates that the first public key was signed by the
  private key corresponding to the provided CA certificate and the
  size of the input buffer is correct.

  \warning
  It is the responsibility of the caller to authenticate the
  EpidCaCertificate.

  \param[in] buf
  Pointer to buffer containing public key to extract.

  \param[in] len
  The size of buf in bytes.

  \param[in] cert
  The issuing CA public key certificate.

  \param[out] pubkey
  The extracted group public key.

  \returns ::EpidStatus

  \retval ::kEpidSigInvalid
  Parsing failed due to data authentication failure.
