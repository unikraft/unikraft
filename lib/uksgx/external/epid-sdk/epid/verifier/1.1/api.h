  \defgroup Epid11VerifierModule Intel(R) EPID 1.1 support

  To verify signatures coming from member devices that belong to an
  Intel&reg; EPID 1.1 group, you need to use Intel&reg; EPID 1.1
  verifier APIs.

  If you are acting as a verifier for both Intel&reg; EPID 1.1 and 2.0
  members, you can determine if you need version 1.1 or 2.0
  verification by checking the Intel&reg; EPID version field in the
  group public key file (see ::EpidParseFileHeader). You can also
  check the version in other binary issuer material, such as the
  GroupRL and SigRL.

  The 1.1 verifier APIs take a verifier context as input. Each
  verifier context (::Epid11VerifierCtx) represents a verifier for a
  single group.

  The Intel&reg; EPID 1.1 specification does not provide hash algorithm
  selection and verifier blacklist revocation. Therefore, APIs such as
  ::EpidVerifierSetHashAlg and ::EpidVerifierSetVerifierRl are not
  available.

  You can find the Intel&reg; EPID 1.1 API headers in the 1.1
  directories, for example, `epid/verifier/1.1/api.h`.

  Intel&reg; EPID 1.1 APIs and data structures are indicated with the
  "Epid11" prefix. For example, the Intel&reg; EPID 1.1 version of
  ::EpidParseGroupPubKeyFile is called ::Epid11ParseGroupPubKeyFile,
  and the Intel&reg; EPID 1.1 version of `GroupRl` is `Epid11GroupRl`.
