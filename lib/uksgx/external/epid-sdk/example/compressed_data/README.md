## Description

There are 2 groups

- **groupa**

- **groupb**

### Group A

**groupa** contains 8 members. Each member has a member private key
`mprivkey.dat`. Here are the members:

- **member0** - a member in good standing

- **member1** - a member in good standing

- **privrevokedmember0** - a member revoked using its private key

- **privrevokedmember1** - a member revoked using its private key

- **privrevokedmember2** - a member revoked using its private key

- **sigrevokedmember0** - a member revoked using a signature

- **sigrevokedmember1** - a member revoked using a signature

- **sigrevokedmember2** - a member revoked using a signature


In addition, **groupa** contain the following revocation lists:

- `pubkey.bin` - group public key

- `privrl.bin` - private key based revocation list with 3 entries -
  **privrevokedmember0**, **privrevokedmember1** and
  **privrevokedmember2**

- `sigrl.bin` - signature based revocation list with 3 entries -
  **sigrevokedmember0**, **sigrevokedmember2** and
  **sigrevokedmember2**

- `privrl_empty.bin` - private key based revocation list with 0 entries

- `sigrl_empty.bin` - signature based revocation list with 0 entries


### Group B

**groupb** contains 3 members. Each member has a member private key
`mprivkey.dat`. Here are the members:

- **member0** - a member in good standing

- **privrevokedmember0** - a member whose private key is revoked

- **sigrevokedmember0** - a member whose signature is revoked


In addition, **groupb** contain the following revocation lists:

- `pubkey.bin` - group public key

- `privrl.bin` - private key based revocation list with 1 entry -
  **privrevokedmember0**

- `sigrl.bin` - signature based revocation list with 1 entry -
  **sigrevokedmember0**

- `privrl_empty.bin` - private key based revocation list with 0 entries

- `sigrl_empty.bin` - signature based revocation list with 0 entries


### Default files

- `cacert.bin` - CA certificate used as default input to signmsg
  and `verifysig`

- `grprl.bin` - group revocation list with one entry **groupb** used
  as default input to `verifysig`

- `pubkey.bin` - public key in **groupa** used as default input
  to signmsg and `verifysig`

- `mprivkey.dat` - private key of a **member0** in the
  **groupa** used as default input to `signmsg`

- `privrl.bin` - private key based revocation list in the
  **groupa** with 3 entries used as default input to `verifysig`

- `sigrl.bin` - signature based revocation list in the
  **groupa** with 3 entries used as default input to `signmsg`
  and `verifysig`

### Group revocation lists

There are 2 group revocation lists:

- `grprl.bin` - group revocation list with 100 entries

- `grprl_empty.bin` - group revocation list with 0 entries


### IoT Issuing CA certificate

- `cacert.bin` - CA certificate used to check that revocation
  lists and group public keys are authorized by the issuer, e.g.,
  signed by the issuer
