## Propagation Kinds

The DNNL library provides performance critical primitives to
accelerate operations used both during **training** deep learning models and
during the operations performed when the models are used for **inference**.

During inference, the input data is fed into the trained model which in turn
produces a result (e.g. makes a prediction). This process is usually called
forward propagation and corresponds to the #dnnl::prop_kind::forward_inference
propagation kind in DNNL.

Training usually consists of the following steps.
1. Make prediction based on the current state of the model.
   As in the case of inference, this step is called **forward** propagation,
   but corresponds to the #dnnl::prop_kind::forward_training propagation kind.
   Note the difference in the names' suffixes:
   `_training` here versus `_inference` mentioned above.
   The differences are covered below in the corresponding
   [section](@ref dev_guide_inference_and_training_forward_training_vs_inference)
   below.
2. Compute an error between predicted and the *actual* answer.
3. Perform the backward propagation of errors to compute the weights (learnable
   parameters) gradient.
   For a given operation (layer) the backward propagation in turn can be split
   into two steps:
   - Propagating error with respect to data, i.e. computing `diff_src` from
     `diff_dst` (see @ref dev_guide_conventions). This step corresponds
     to the #dnnl::prop_kind::backward_data propagation kind;
   - Propagating error with respect to weights, i.e. computing `diff_weights`
     from `diff_dst`.
     This step makes sense only for the operations that have learnable
     parameters and corresponds to the #dnnl::prop_kind::backward_weights
     propagation kind.
4. Use computed gradients to modify the weights according to the chosen solver
   to improve the accuracy of the model.

<!-- @todo It would be nice to have a picture here. -->


### Difference Between Forward Propagation on Training and Inference
@anchor dev_guide_inference_and_training_forward_training_vs_inference

Even though, mathematically, the forward propagation that happens during
training and inference should be the same, in practice there are some
differences mostly due to the performance considerations.

When executing inference, one may not care about values in the intermediate
buffers during a model execution; hence one can reuse them as desired. However,
if this is a forward propagation of a training it is beneficial to preserve
input data, output data, or sometimes some intermediate data, that will later
be used at the backward propagation to compute the gradients.

For example, let's take max pooling (@ref dev_guide_pooling with algorithm
kind #dnnl::algorithm::pooling_max) as an example. The forward pass consists
of computing the maximum values in the sliding window over the source tensor.
Hence the output is just another tensor that contain these maximum values.
However, in order to compute source gradient on backward propagation one needs
to know the position of these maximum values in the source tensor. Of course,
it is possible to use the original source tensor to locate the maximums again,
but this might be more expensive compared to preserving the positions of
the maximum values in another tensor, that will be then used during the
backward propagation.
DNNL uses the latter approach: for max pooling primitive when
the propagation kind is set to #dnnl::prop_kind::forward_training
the library produces one extra output called
[Workspace](@ref dev_guide_inference_and_training_aspects_workspace)
which will be covered later in this document.

@note
    Key takeaways:
    - Always use #dnnl::prop_kind::forward_inference when running inference;
      use #dnnl::prop_kind::forward_training for forward pass of training.
    - The number of a primitive's outputs might be greater by 1 if it was
      created with #dnnl::prop_kind::forward_training because of the extra
      [Workspace](@ref dev_guide_inference_and_training_aspects_workspace)
      memory.

### Different Backward Propagation Kinds
@anchor dev_guide_inference_and_training_aspects_difference_backward_prop_kinds

As mentioned above, DNNL separates error back-propagation with respect
to data and error back-propagation with respect to weights. The former
corresponds to #dnnl::prop_kind::backward_data, while the latter corresponds
to #dnnl::prop_kind::backward_weights (for example:
@ref dev_guide_convolution).

## Inference-Specific Aspects

The following list outlines the key specifics of running inference
with DNNL:

1. As described above, always use #dnnl::prop_kind::forward_inference
   as a propagation kind.

2. To get maximum performance, consider performing operations in-place
   whenever possible (e.g. @ref dev_guide_eltwise and
   @ref dev_guide_batch_normalization). Check the primitives documentation
   pages to check which primitives support in-place operations.

3. Create primitives once, and reuse them across multiple model invocations.
   This is especially relevant for the frameworks integration.

4. Some primitives can be chained/fused with others using
   the [post-ops attributes](@ref dev_guide_attributes_post_ops).
   This allows reducing memory bandwidth pressure and typically leads to
   better performance.

Most of these techniques are shown in the following examples:
- @ref cnn_inference_f32_cpp
- @ref cnn_inference_int8_cpp

## Training-Specific Aspects

The following list outlines the key specifics of running training
with DNNL:

1. During the forward propagation, use #dnnl::prop_kind::forward_training
   as a propagation kind.

2. During backward propagation, perform backward by data and backward by
   weights using the corresponding propagation kinds.
   - Note that some primitives may combine these operations if that is
     beneficial from a performance perspective. For example, @ref
     dev_guide_rnn and @ref dev_guide_batch_normalization compute both
     `diff_src` and `diff_weights` at the same time.
     To highlight this behavior, the propagation kind is set
     to #dnnl::prop_kind::backward.

3. Create primitives once, and reuse them across multiple model invocations.
   This is especially relevant for the frameworks integration.

4. The [post-ops attributes](@ref dev_guide_attributes_post_ops) in general
   are not applicable for training, because the fused computations they result
   in do not produce the intermediate tensors which may be required during the
   backward propagation. For example, if you fuse @ref dev_guide_convolution
   and @ref dev_guide_eltwise the direct output of the convolution would not
   be produced. However, it might be required during the backward propagation
   of the corresponding element-wise. (To compute `diff_src`, one must pass
   `diff_dst` memory and the original `src` memory, which was exactly the
   intermediate one.)

5. To compute backward propagation, different primitives might require
   different tensors. The variety is caused by the mathematical formulas.
   For example, to compute backward propagation for @ref dev_guide_eltwise
   one needs to pass `diff_dst` and `src`, but to compute backward propagation
   for @ref dev_guide_softmax, one needs to pass `diff_dst` and `dst`.
   Check the documentation for each primitive to see what is required
   for each particular primitive.

6. For the primitives that are created with #dnnl::memory::format_tag::any
   memory format tag, there are no guarantees that the memory format on forward
   and backward propagations will match. So the robust integration should
   always be ready to emit @ref dev_guide_reorder when necessary.
   For example, it is not guaranteed that the `src` memory format of a
   convolution on forward propagation will always match the `src` memory
   format of the corresponding convolution on backward by weights propagation.
   Of course, the library tries to avoid unnecessary reorder, so in most cases
   the formats will be the same, but this would by no means always be true.

7. For the memory bandwidth bound primitives like @ref dev_guide_eltwise,
   @ref dev_guide_pooling, and @ref dev_guide_batch_normalization, it is
   important to have `diff_dst` in the same memory format as the original
   `dst`. The mismatch of the formats would lead to significant performance
   issues. To ensure the proper format, users should always use
   #dnnl::memory::format_tag::any memory format for gradient tensors
   (`diff_dst`, `diff_src`). If a primitive requires original data tensors
   (e.g. `src` in @ref dev_guide_eltwise or `dst` in @ref dev_guide_softmax)
   user **must** pass fully defined memory descriptor for these tensors. In
   other words `src` and `dst` memory descriptors cannot be initialized with
   #dnnl::memory::format_tag::any for backward propagation.
   Based on the format of the original tensors, if any, and on forward
   primitive descriptor hint (see bullet 9 below) a primitive picks the proper
   format for the gradients.  Occasionally, it might appear that the `diff_dst`
   that comes in is in other memory format than the primitive requires, hence
   robust integration code must be prepared to emit a reorder.
   - Alternatively, users may manually enforce `diff_dst` to have the same
     memory format as `dst`, though this is not recommended.

8. Some primitives require an additional tensor to be passed between forward
   and backward propagation, which is called
   [Workspace](@ref dev_guide_inference_and_training_aspects_workspace).

9. When creating primitive descriptors on backward propagation, you might need
   to pass a primitive descriptor of the corresponding primitive from the
   forward propagation (in the API this primitive descriptor is typically
   called *hint*). This hint is required for the primitive to choose a proper
   implementation that would correspond to the one from the forward
   propagation. This is required only for the primitives that produce
   `workspace`, because it might be different for different implementations.

10. When creating your working memory and mkl-dnn memory descriptor, specify
   the type of memory you want to work with. This can be either 16-bit Brain Float
   (bf16) or 32-bit Floating Point (fp32). More details about using bf16 for training
   are detailed in the section @ref dev_guide_training_bf16.

Most of these techniques are shown in the following examples:
- @ref cnn_training_f32_cpp
- @ref cpu_cnn_training_bf16_cpp

@anchor dev_guide_inference_and_training_aspects_workspace
## Workspace

DNNL uses the notion of `workspace` for some very particular cases.
Specifically, the `workspace` is a tensor that the primitive fills in during
forward propagation and that will then be used by the corresponding backward
propagation operation. The example with max pooling was already discussed
above.

The workflow for using workspace is:
1. When creating a primitive for the forward propagation, query the primitive
   descriptor about the workspace requirement using `.workspace_desc()`.
   - If the returned memory descriptor is essentially empty (i.e. is equal to
     `dnnl::memory::desc()` or for which @ref dnnl::memory::desc::get_size()
     returns 0), no extra action is required--the workspace is not required
     for this primitive in this configuration.
   - Otherwise, create a workspace memory based on the memory descriptor
     obtained and pass it to the execution function with
     `DNNL_ARG_WORKSPACE` tag.

2. On backward propagation, attach that same workspace memory during
   the execution as well. The state of the workspace memory after backward
   computations are done is undefined.

@note Even if workspace is not required, it is perfectly valid to create a
`workspace` memory of zero size and follow the logic where the workspace is
indeed required. Such an approach may simplify the integration because the
common pass is used.


~~~cpp
// FWD

auto forward_primitive_desc = ...::primitive_desc(); // create a primitive desc
auto workspace_md = forward_primitive_desc.workspace_desc(); // query workspace
memory workspace(workspace_md, engine); // create a memory (even if empty)

primitive_forward.execute(stream, {
        ...,
        {DNNL_ARG_WORKSPACE, workspace} // this is output
        });
// The workspace contains required information for the backward propagation,
// hence should not be used anywhere else.

// ...

// BWD
primitive_backward.execute(stream, {
        ...,
        {DNNL_ARG_WORKSPACE, workspace} // this input/output
        });
// The state of the workspace is undefined here
~~~


@warning
    Do not confuse **workspace** with the @ref dev_guide_attributes_scratchpad.
    The scratchpad is a temporary buffer that might be required by a primitive
    (no matter what propagation kind is) to perform an operation. It is used
    only during the primitive execution and should not be preserved across the
    calls.
