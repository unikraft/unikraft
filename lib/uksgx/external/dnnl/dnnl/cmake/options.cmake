    This option must be turned on if there is a possibility of concurrent
    execution of primitives that were created in the same thread.
    CAUTION: enabling this option increases memory consumption"

    changed without prior notification in future releases" OFF)

# Optimizations

set(DNNL_ARCH_OPT_FLAGS "HostOpts" CACHE STRING
    "specifies compiler optimization flags (see below for more information).
    If empty default optimization level would be applied which depends on the
    compiler being used.

    - For Intel(R) C++ Compilers the default option is `-xSSE4.1` which instructs
      the compiler to generate the code for the processors that support SSE4.1
      instructions. This option would not allow to run the library on older
      architectures.

    - For GNU* Compiler Collection and Clang, the default option is `-msse4.1` which
      behaves similarly to the description above.

    - For all other cases there are no special optimizations flags.

    If the library is to be built for generic architecture (e.g. built by a
    Linux distributive maintainer) one may want to specify DNNL_ARCH_OPT_FLAGS=\"\"
    to not use any host specific instructions")
