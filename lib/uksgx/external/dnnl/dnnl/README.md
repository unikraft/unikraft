Deep Neural Network Library (DNNL) is an
open-source performance library for deep learning applications. The library
includes basic building blocks for neural networks optimized
for Intel Architecture Processors and Intel Processor Graphics.

DNNL is intended for deep learning applications and framework
developers interested in improving application performance
on Intel CPUs and GPUs. Deep learning practitioners should use one of the
applications enabled with DNNL:

# Installation

Pre-built binaries for Linux\*, Windows\*, and macOS\* are available for download
in the [releases section](https://github.com/intel/mkl-dnn/releases). Package
names use the following convention:

| OS      | Package name
| :------ | :-----------
| Linux   | `dnnl_lnx_<version>_cpu_<cpu runtime>[_gpu_<gpu runtime>].tgz`
| Windows | `dnnl_win_<version>_cpu_<cpu runtime>[_gpu_<gpu runtime>].zip`
| macOS   | `dnnl_mac_<version>_cpu_<cpu runtime>.tgz`

Several packages are available for each operating system to ensure
interoperability with CPU or GPU runtime libraries used by the application.

| Configuration | Dependency
| :-------------| :---------
| `cpu_iomp`    | Intel OpenMP runtime
| `cpu_gomp`    | GNU\* OpenMP runtime
| `cpu_vcomp`   | Microsoft Visual C OpenMP runtime
| `cpu_tbb`     | Threading Building Blocks

The packages do not include library dependencies and these need to be resolved
in the application at build time. See the
[System Requirements](#system-requirements) section below and the
[Build Options](http://intel.github.io/mkl-dnn/dev_guide_build_options.html)
section in the [developer guide](http://intel.github.io/mkl-dnn) for more
details on CPU and GPU runtimes.

If the configuration you need is not available, you can
[build the library from source](http://intel.github.io/mkl-dnn/dev_guide_build.html).

# System Requirements
DNNL supports systems based on Intel 64 architecture or
compatible processors.

The library is optimized for the following CPUs:
* Intel Atom processor with Intel SSE4.1 support
* 4th, 5th, 6th, 7th, and 8th generation Intel Core(TM) processor
* Intel Xeon(R) processor E3, E5, and E7 family (formerly Sandy Bridge,
  Ivy Bridge, Haswell, and Broadwell)
* Intel Xeon Phi(TM) processor (formerly Knights Landing and Knights Mill)
* Intel Xeon Scalable processor (formerly Skylake and Cascade Lake)
* future Intel Xeon Scalable processor (code name Cooper Lake)

DNNL detects instruction set architecture (ISA) in the runtime and uses
just-in-time (JIT) code generation to deploy the code optimized
for the latest supported ISA.

The library is optimized for the following GPUs:
* Intel HD Graphics
* Intel UHD Graphics
* Intel Iris Plus Graphics

## Requirements for Building from Source
DNNL supports systems meeting the following requirements:
* Operating sytem with Intel 64 architecture support
* C++ compiler with C++11 standard support
* [CMake](https://cmake.org/download/) 2.8.11 or later
* [Doxygen](http://www.doxygen.nl/download.html#srcbin) 1.8.5 or later to build
documentation

Configurations of CPU and GPU engines may introduce additional build time
dependencies.

### CPU Engine
Intel Architecture Processors and compatible devices are supported by the
DNNL CPU engine. The CPU engine is built by default and cannot
be disabled at build time. The engine can be configured to use the OpenMP or
TBB threading runtime. The following additional requirements apply:
* OpenMP runtime requires C++ compiler with OpenMP 2.0 or later standard support
* TBB runtime requires
[Threading Building Blocks (TBB)](https://www.threadingbuildingblocks.org/)
2017 or later.

Some implementations rely on OpenMP 4.0 SIMD extensions, and we recommend using
the Intel C++ Compiler for the best performance results.

### GPU Engine
Intel Processor Graphics is supported by the DNNL GPU engine. The GPU
engine is disabled in the default build configuration. The following
additional requirements apply when GPU engine is enabled:
* OpenCL\* runtime library (OpenCL version 1.2 or later)
* OpenCL driver (with kernel language support for OpenCL C 2.0 or later)
  with Intel subgroups extension support
