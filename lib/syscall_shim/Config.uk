		Automatically generate libc-style stubs for unavailable
		system calls. The aim is to provide all libc-style system
		call symbols although just a subset of the full API may be
		implemtented. The symbols are defined as `weak`.
		Please note that depending on the used compiler and optimization
		options, this functionality may sometimes cause linking failures
		because of double definitions of symbols. This is the case when
		another library is providing some libc-style system calls
		without registering them to libsyscall_shim.

			Enables a system call handler for binary system call
			requests (e.g., sysenter/sysexit). The handler maps
			register values accordingly to the Linux ABI standard
			(see: man syscalls[2]).
